## 🧐 About

Interviews are like a dance. You either need to remember all the steps to
perform it mechanically, or you let it flow. The latter, in interview terms,
may leave important aspects unanswered, which is not good.

I'm a terrible dancer, so I need to write down all the questions upfront. That
way I can avoid traps like poor job descriptions or candidates bluffing about
their knowledge.

Here you can find two PDF form templates, one to use as a candidate and another
as an interviewer. They have staple questions for different aspects. They aren't
meant as an absolute sequence that you must ask always; you should pick the ones
that you feel are most relevant or that require more clarification.

They also include custom, blank question fields at the end to adapt anything in
particular for that interview.

## 🏁 Getting Started

If you want a ready-to-use template, then either grab a PDF release here in
GitHub or build yourself using `make build`.

## 🎈 Usage
